## This is a PowerShell-based GitHub Action using:
##    https://github.com/ebekker/pwsh-github-action-base

name: gh-action-buildnum
author: EBekker
description: |
  Generates build numbers for Workflow runs, across a number
  of _scopes_ useful for build tracking and versioning.

inputs:

  gist_token:
    required: true
    description: |
      GitHub OAuth/PAT token to be used for accessing Gist to store builder number state.
      The integrated GITHUB_TOKEN that is normally accessible during a Workflow does not
      include read/write permissions to associated Gists, therefore a separate token is
      needed.  You can control which account is used to actually store the state by
      generating a token associated with the target account. 

  repo_full_name:
    required: false
    description: |
      The name of the current repository, in `<OWNER>/<REPO-NAME>` format.
      This input is optional and is only used to override the default value
      which is pulled in from the running Workflow context.  This value is
      used to compute a unique identifier for the Gist that will be used to
      store state for current and subsequent build numbers.
      Default is `$env:GITHUB_REPOSITORY`.

  workflow_name:
    required: false
    description: |
      The name of the workflow to identify the build number with.
      This input is optional and is only used to override the default value
      which is pulled in from the running Workflow context.  This value is
      used to compute a unique identifier for the Gist that will be used to
      store state for current and subsequent build numbers.
      Default is `$env:GITHUB_WORKFLOW`.

  version_key:
    required: false
    description: |
      A unique identifer used to calculate a version-specific build number.

  skip_bump:
    required: false
    description: |
      If true, this will skip bumping up the build numbers, and only pulls
      in the last values stored in the state Gist.

  set_env:
    required: false
    description: |
      If true, this will export the resolved version numbers as environment
      variables for the current and future steps.

outputs:

  global_build_number:
    description: |
      Resolved build number for the repository or `global` scope.
  workflow_build_number:
    description: |
      Resolved build number for the Workflow scope.
  version_build_number:
    description: |
      Resolved build number for the Version scope.

## Even though the Action logic may be implemented
## in PWSH, we still need a NodeJS entry point
